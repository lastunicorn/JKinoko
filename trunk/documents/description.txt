JKinoko v1.0
============

There are three projects in the solution at the moment:
	- JKinoko - the framework
	- JKinoko.Example - an example of how the framework can be used.
	- JKinoko.Tests - unit tests - incomplete


Future features
------------------
	- Create a console application that can take as parameter a jar and a method name and measure it.
